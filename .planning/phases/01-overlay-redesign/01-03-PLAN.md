<objective>
Visually verify the redesigned overlay matches WisprFlow-style aesthetic and all functionality works correctly across position modes.

Purpose: Human verification ensures the visual redesign achieves the intended "invisible interface" aesthetic that automated tests cannot evaluate.
Output: Verified overlay that looks and feels like WisprFlow, ready for next phase.

  <what-built>
WisprFlow-style floating pill overlay with:
- Dark minimal theme (near-black background, subtle border)
- Pill shape with rounded ends
- Enhanced animations (entry/exit scale+fade, pulsing mic, animated audio bars)
- FollowCursor positioning mode added to backend
- All existing functionality preserved (ESC cancel, state transitions)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the app: `bun run tauri dev`

2. Test BOTTOM position (default):
   - Trigger recording with your hotkey (Ctrl+Space or Option+Space)
   - Verify overlay appears at bottom-center of screen
   - Check: Dark pill shape with soft shadow (NOT harsh box shadow)
   - Check: Mic icon pulses gently during recording
   - Check: Audio level bars animate with your voice
   - Press ESC to cancel - verify smooth fade-out animation
   - Release hotkey - verify smooth fade-out

3. Test TOP position:
   - Open settings store file or use command to change overlay_position to "top"
   - Trigger recording
   - Verify overlay appears at top-center of screen
   - Verify all animations still work

4. Test transcribing state:
   - Complete a recording (don't cancel)
   - Verify "Transcribing..." text appears with pulse animation
   - Verify overlay fades out after transcription completes

5. Test FOLLOWCURSOR position:
   - Change overlay_position to "followcursor"
   - Move cursor to different part of screen
   - Trigger recording
   - Verify overlay appears near cursor (below it, centered horizontally)
   - Test near screen edges - overlay should stay within bounds

6. Visual checklist:
   - [ ] Overlay is pill-shaped (rounded ends)
   - [ ] Background is dark (near black)
   - [ ] Border is subtle (not harsh white/black line)
   - [ ] Shadow is soft and elevated (not flat box shadow)
   - [ ] Audio bars have gradient color
   - [ ] Cancel button has X icon and hover effect
   - [ ] Animations feel smooth (<300ms, no jank)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if overlay looks good and all positions work.
Or describe specific issues that need fixing (e.g., "shadow too harsh", "bars not animating", "followcursor places overlay off-screen").
  </resume-signal>
</task>

<verification>
Human has confirmed:
- Visual design matches WisprFlow aesthetic
- All three position modes work (top, bottom, followcursor)
- Animations are smooth and polished
- No regressions in existing functionality
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User approves visual design as "WisprFlow-style"
- All position modes functional
- No visual glitches or jarring animations
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (Command Palette)
</success_criteria>
