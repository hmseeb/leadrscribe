<objective>
Visual and functional verification of the complete real-time transcription display feature.

Purpose: Confirm the entire end-to-end flow works correctly with real speech input.

Output: User approval or list of issues to address.

  <what-built>
Complete real-time transcription display feature:
- Dark translucent bar appears above the recording overlay during recording
- Speech is transcribed in ~2.5 second chunks and text appears progressively
- Words animate in with spring animation
- Green pulse indicator shows active listening
- When recording stops, streaming text is replaced by the final batch transcription
- Display hides after final text is pasted
- Click on the display dismisses it
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the dev environment: run `run-dev.bat` or `bun run tauri dev`
2. Trigger a recording using your configured shortcut
3. Verify: A dark translucent bar appears above the recording pill overlay
4. Verify: The bar shows a pulsing green dot on the left and "Listening..." placeholder text
5. Speak a sentence clearly for 5-10 seconds
6. Verify: After ~2-3 seconds of speech, partial text begins appearing in the dark bar
7. Verify: Words fade/spring in with subtle animation
8. Verify: If you speak enough, text scrolls as it grows
9. Stop the recording using your configured shortcut
10. Verify: The "Transcribing..." state appears in the recording pill
11. Verify: When batch transcription completes, the streaming text in the dark bar is replaced with the final result
12. Verify: The transcription display and recording pill both disappear
13. Verify: The final text is pasted into the active application
14. Click test: Start recording, wait for text to appear, click the dark bar - verify it dismisses

Specific things to evaluate:
- Is the bar positioned correctly (above the recording pill)?
- Is the text readable (contrast, font size, spacing)?
- Is the animation smooth (no janky word reveals)?
- Does the bar feel responsive (text appears within 3-5s of speaking)?
- Does the final text replacement feel natural (not jarring)?
